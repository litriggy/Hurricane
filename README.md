# Hurricane Client

This fork includes an optional local MCP bridge for OpenCode. See
[MCP setup and tools](mcp/README.md) for building the modified client and connecting
OpenCode. The bridge is disabled by default.

This is just another custom client you can use to play the wonderful game,
Haven & Hearth. This client is built on top of the "Vanilla" Client, and
does not depend on any other custom clients.
I try to merge all of the code changes that are done to the base client
by Loftar, and I try to keep it up to date, to avoid crashes.

This client can be played standalone, or through Steam, by subscribing to
the Steam Workshop item.

Important Note:
- This client does not send any data to any place besides the official Seatribe server, unless you set it to do so.

## Downloading/Updating the Hurricane Client (Outside of Steam):
Use the Hurricane Updater: https://github.com/Nightdawg/Hurricane-Updater/releases/latest/download/HurricaneUpdater.jar
(Source Code: https://github.com/Nightdawg/Hurricane-Updater)

### If the updater doesn't work:
1. Make sure your installed Java version is **any version between Java 17 and Java 25**
2. You might need to add the updater file (HurricaneUpdater.jar) to your anti-virus exceptions list.

## Launching the Hurricane Client (Outside of Steam):

Run the Play.bat file inside the client folder, or Play_Linux.sh (for Linux/MacOS)

The client works with **any version between Java 17 and Java 25**
I've also been playing on GraalVM (some different open-source java distribution based on OpenJDK),
and I seem to get like 15-20 extra FPS out of the client.

### If the client doesn't launch:
1. Make sure your installed Java version is **any version between Java 17 and Java 25**
2. You might need to add the launcher file (Play.bat or Play_Linux.sh) to your anti-virus exceptions list.


## This client also supports Cediner's Web Map server (you set up your own private map server, it's not a public map):
https://github.com/Cediner/hnh-map-vuetify 

Ganhart/Aritain's updated version: https://github.com/Aritain/hnh-map-updated

## OR you can use dafels' Mapping service (or set up your own private map server):

## Additionally, the client also supports the cookbook integration (disabled by default).
You can either use a token from a public cookbook, or host your own (for example, https://github.com/Cediner/hnh-food-book)
